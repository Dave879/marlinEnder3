# marlinEnder3
This repository hosts my Marlin configuration.

My Ender 3 is basically stock: the only modification I made is to change the MELZI board with an SKR 1.4 Turbo with TMC 2209 on all axis.

!! Sensorless homing is not enabled !!

Feel free to use this with your printer if oyu are having trouble configuring Marlin by yourself.

Known issues:
When doing manual bed levelling, the bottom part of the text is cut off when changing probing points.

Full list of features enabled (work in progress):

1. Mesh bed Levelling
2. Home axis indipendently
3. Babystepping
4. Power outage
5. 
6.
